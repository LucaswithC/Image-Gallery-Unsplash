## Overview

![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtc8u5oa0/image/upload/v1637163487/Screenshot_2021-11-17_at_16-37-32_Image_Gallery_p4twcw.png)

Hi, this is my Submission for the Unsplash Gallery Challenge. At first I just saved the Images url in the JS File, but than other users couldn't see the pictures other users added. After I completed the [CatWiki Challenge](https://github.com/LucaswithC/Cat-Wiki) I knew how to create an API and how to save and change a json file on the Server. Now the urls are saved and anyone can edit and see the submitted Pictures.

You can see the finished Gallery here: [Gallery](https://gallery-lucas.netlify.app/)
